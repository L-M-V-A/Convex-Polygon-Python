The code for ConvexPolygon code was hastily done last minute when Professor
Piyush made the comment in class that it had to be pure python, and that the
assumption was that there would be no error checking involved for the data input
when creating an object of ConvexPolygon.
The code itself is mostly a rehashing of someone else's work. That person is
Charles Marsh, and it was "paraphrased" from his repository on github:

https://github.com/crm416/point-location

Most of the work went into how to format it accordingly to meet the criteria
specified for the homework and making it pep8 compliant, create a test case to
reach full coverage, and achieve a 10.0/10.0 in pylint.

I also utilized the even-odd rule algorithm to locate whether an objec was
located along the boundaries of the polygon, of which was repurposed from the
wikipedia page for the algorithm. Ironically, it was not my intention but I
couldn't unsee it.

The only shortcoming arising from the behavior of pylint with disabling certain
warnings in both my original implementation of ConvexPolygon(below) done
matplotlib.
________________________________________________________________________________
Makefile has the commands to call on the necessary testing:
1. pep8_res = for pep8 standard check
2. pylint_point = self explanatory
3. pylint_convex = self explanatory
4. coverage = coverage only testing point.py and convex_polygon.py

This homework was written with the utilization of modules from the package
"matplotlib". More specifically "mlab" for its method "inside_poly" and, "path"
for its contained class "Path" and its method "contains_point".

I specifically included the following disabled messages from pylint:
1. R0903 = "Too Few Methods," in point.py and mpl_convex_polygon.py
2. I0011 = "Locally disabling method %r," in mpl_convex_polygon.py
3. W0201 = "Attribute %r defined outside __init__", in mpl_convex_polygon.py
4. W0612 = "Unused-variable," in mpl_convex_polygon.py

The statements causing these errors are mentioned in the comments at the
beginning of convex_polygon.py.
